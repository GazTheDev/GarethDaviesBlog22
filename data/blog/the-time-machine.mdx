## Welcome to my blog


I'd like to take this chance to welcome you to my brand new blog. I had always wanted to do some rambling online and finally I have a blog. 

The blog will just be me talking about random subjects that interest me. It can range from History to coding tips. I'm pretty much using
this platform as a way to vent and write whatever is on my mind. I'm sure there will be something interesting to read. 

For those geeks who are reading. I built this website using NextJS and Tailwind CSS. 

I have disabled comments for the timebeing but will be enabled once the site is up and running. 

Anyway, I'll let you get back to your day. Have a good one!
