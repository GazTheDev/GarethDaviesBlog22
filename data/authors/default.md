Hello, my name is Gareth. I currently work for PGL Travel as a Night Support Team Leader. However, my main background is in programming and web design. I have several hobbies and interests including the railway, Bell Ringing and coding. 

In my spare time away from my day job you will either find me at a Train Station, near a church bell ringing or somewhere coding and figuring out now to build something. 

I aim to cover my hobbies in posts at somepoint so make sure to watch out.
